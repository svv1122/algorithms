Brute Force
===========
Brute force is a straightforward and general problem-solving technique that systematically tries all possible solutions until the correct one is found.

It does not apply any clever optimizations or heuristics; instead, it relies on **exhaustive search** through all potential options.

Brute force is often easy to implement but can be inefficient, especially for large input sizes or complex problems.

Key Characteristics:
--------------------
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and code.
- **Exhaustiveness**: Checks every possible solution without skipping any possibility.
- **Guarantees Correctness**: Always finds a solution if one exists.
- **High Time Complexity**: Often not practical for large problems due to exponential growth in execution time.

Applications:
-------------
- Linear search in an unsorted array
- Password cracking by trying every possible combination
- Generating all subsets, permutations, or combinations
- Solving puzzles like Sudoku by checking all possible number placements

Advantages:
-----------
- Simple to design and implement
- No need for problem-specific knowledge

Disadvantages:
--------------
- Extremely inefficient for large datasets
- High computational and memory cost

In practice, brute force is usually replaced by more efficient algorithms once a basic solution is understood.
