Description
===========
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ⓘ) is a finite 
sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class 
of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as 
specifications for performing calculations and data processing. More advanced 
algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes 
(referred to as automated decision-making) and deduce valid inferences (referred to 
as automated reasoning).

In contrast, a **heuristic** is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct 
or optimal results.[2] For example, although social media recommender systems are commonly 
called "algorithms", they actually rely on heuristics as there is **no** truly "correct" recommendation.

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[3] and 
in a well-defined formal language[4] for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and 
initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds 
through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[8] and 
terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is **not** necessarily 
deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9]
