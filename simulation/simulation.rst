Simulation
==========
A simulation algorithm is a computational technique used to imitate the behavior of a real-world system or process over time. It involves creating a model that can be used to study the performance or predict the behavior of the system under various conditions.

Key Characteristics
-------------------
- **Model-Based**: Requires a well-defined model that describes the system behavior.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Simulates the system by progressing in discrete time steps or events.
- **State Tracking**: Keeps track of the internal state and changes over time.

Types of Simulation
-------------------
- **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)**: Focuses on events that change the state of the system at specific points in time.
- **Continuous Simulation**: Models systems that change continuously over time (e.g., physical systems using differential equations).
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents.

Applications
------------
Simulation algorithms are widely used in:

- **Operations Research**
- **Queueing Systems**
- **Traffic Flow Modeling**
- **Game Development**
- **Financial Systems**
- **Epidemiology**

Advantages
----------
- Useful for complex systems that are difficult to analyze analytically
- Allows testing of scenarios without real-world consequences
- Helps with decision-making and planning

Disadvantages
-------------
- Can be computationally expensive
- Requires accurate models and assumptions
- Results may be sensitive to input parameters and random variations

Example
-------
A **queue simulation**:

Simulate a bank with a single teller. Customers arrive at random intervals, and each takes a random amount of time to be served. A simulation can help determine the average waiting time, queue length, and utilization of the teller.
